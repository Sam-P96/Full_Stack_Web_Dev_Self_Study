    <h1>This is the main header</h1>
    <p>This is just a regular paragraph, and there is absolutely no reason
        to think too much about this code. I am just writing this while listening 
        to the video tutorial teach me about the history of CSS and HTML. Anyway, 
        now she is talking about the face, color, size attributes, etc. She is also
        talking about deprecated attributes. So, we're just being taught to not
        use our styling in the html file.

    <h2>Behold, the CSS file!</h2>
    <p draggable="true">Now we can style the website without worries.</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="behold_li">Now we can color it differently</li>
        <li class="behold_li">At some point we will learn about selectors</li>
        <li class="behold_li">Hopefully we'll find something good to do.</li>
