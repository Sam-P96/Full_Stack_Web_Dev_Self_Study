<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>It was the resolution to so many major plot elements and character arcs. 
While the cinematography was nothing to write home about, the character writing
and pay off for for 11 years worth of build up was incredible to view in theatres.</p>
<h3>Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed</h3>
<p> A childhood classic, that pits Mystery Inc against their greatest challenges
all in one go. Seeing characters grow from their one-dimensional characatures 
into another different, one-dimensional characature... Great watch. I think.
</p>
<h3>Iron-Man </h3>
<p>A classic, you cannot leave this out of the list. Hohoho!!</p>
